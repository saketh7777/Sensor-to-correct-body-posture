# Sensor-to-correct-body-posture

This project is designed to encourage better ergonomics while using a laptop by monitoring the distance of a user's face from the laptop. If the userâ€™s face is closer than 35 cm to the laptop screen, a buzzer will sound, alerting the user to sit back and maintain a healthier distance. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and a buzzer to provide the alert.
